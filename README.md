# Fake cheat
A fake ghost client. I dosen't do anything. Used to troll your freinds and tell them you are **HaCkInG** 

## Not launching
This is because I programmed it to only launch if minecraft is open. However, that only works on linux/macos.
That means on windows it will not launch even if minecraft is open. To fix that refer to the comment in the **main.py** file

## Dependencies
You will need the pygame python package for it to work
