# Fake cheat
A fake ghost client. I dosen't do anything. Used to troll your freinds and tell them you are **HaCkInG** 

## Not running
This is because it will only open if minecraft is open

## Having issues?
File a bug report <a href="https://github.com/CloudyWhale/fake-cheat/issues">here</a>
## Dependencies
You will need the pygame python package for it to run (unless you are using the exe)

## How to build
Run these commands:
```
pip install pygame
pip install pyinstaller
python -m PyInstaller --icon=logo.ico --noconsole --onefile main.py
```
then copy the fonts and images folders into the dist directory and then you can run the file in the dist directory

If you get an error that says you do not have pip refer to this: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
